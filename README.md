# Performance Assessment for Western Governors University Software 1 (C482).

This is my passing submission that recieved a passing score on June 27, 2023. The contents are exactly how it was submitted in the jar file (excluding the readme). It was written in Apache NetBeans 17 and built using ANT.

The program allows users to manage an inventory of parts and products by taking actions such as adding, updating, and removing items. Usage should be pretty straight forward. Data is non-persistant and has no way to be exported.

The interface was created using JavaFX 20 making use of Scene Builder and fxml files.
